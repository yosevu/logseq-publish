# [About these notes](https://yosevu.github.io/working-notes/#/page/About%20these%20notes)

These are my working notes based on principles from the Zettelkasten writing system. These notes help me connect and [grow what I know over time](https://yosevu.github.io/working-notes/#/page/About%20these%20notes). They leverage Logseq to support this process by making it more effective and efficient.
