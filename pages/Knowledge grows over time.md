alias:: grow what I know over time

- Knowledge grows over time. What you learn connects to and changes what you already know. What you already know shapes and influences what you learn. Andy Matuschak uses the word /accrete/ to describe knowledge work in his note, [Knowledge work should accrete](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Knowledge_work_should_accrete), which evokes the conceptual metaphor [[KNOWLEDGE IS ALIVE]] for me. Knowledge grows and develops along with the person or people who cultivate it.
